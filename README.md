## Tell us about the features and technologies you used.
MilkRoad is a game that aims to make learning about how milk gets to your door easy and fun.

Milk travels through four different stages to reach your home. The four games can be played by following through the map.

In Production, players collect the milk that falls from the cow and fill the milk tank. You use your finger drag to move the basket below to catch the falling milk.

In Pasteurize, you get rid of the bad bacteria in the milk by filling the milk tank. The bacteria in the milk will float around, and you need to only touch the bad ones to remove them.

In Packaging, you have to separate the plastic milk bottles from the paper milk cartons. You can separate the milk by clicking the left and right plastic milk jug buttons and the paper milk carton buttons. If you don't separate incorrectly 3 times, you will be given a chance to try again.

In Delivery, the truck must avoid obstacles to reach the target distance. If you hit an obstacle 3 times, you will be given the opportunity to try again.

### Credits

I would like to thank my mother for inspiring me to create this game. I was a very curious kid as a child, questioning why the sky is blue, how the food on the table got here, why all living things need to drink water, and other things that some people take for granted. My mother always made sure to explain these questions in a way that was easy for me to understand and have fun. For example, when I wondered where carrots came from, she took me to the market where she had a large vegetable garden, and by growing them herself, she made me realize that even small crops don't come easily.

### Design

To make MilkRoad more immersive, I came up with the idea of following a route through a map and designed the environment to immerse you in the adventures along the way. A friend of mine had the idea that it should have the same tone as a game called "Milkchoochoo", so I kept that in mind and used that game as a reference to set the tone. All of the backgrounds, characters, and items in the game were drawn by me.
